# What is fastai?
Fastai is a high-level library built on top of PyTorch that simplifies the deep learning workflow. Fastai combines the complexity and power of pytorch with higher-level abstractions. 
This makes development faster, reduces the likelihood of bugs, and makes the code easier to read and debug.

## Powerful tools in fastai

### Datablock
Datablock gives fastai all the information it needs to create a computer vision model. The datablock tells how to build the dataset, such as wha type of data you have, where to find it, what to label it, how to split it in to training and validation set and what transformers to apply. Itâ€™s a flexible and modular way to prepare your data pipeline, which makes it easy to experiment and reuse the same structure across different projects.

Here's a simple example for an image classification task

```python

dblock = DataBlock(
    blocks=(ImageBlock, CategoryBlock),         # Input is an image, output is a category
    get_items=get_image_files,                  # Find all image files in the folder
    splitter=RandomSplitter(valid_pct=0.2),     # Split data randomly: 20% validation
    get_y=parent_label,                         # Use folder names as labels
    item_tfms=Resize(192)                       # Resize all images to 192x192
)

```

```ImageBlock``` tells fastai we're using images as input.

```CategoryBlock``` means the output is a category (like "cat" or "dog").

```get_image_files(path)``` collects all image files in the folder.

```parent_label``` uses the folder name as the label.

```RandomSplitter``` splits the dataset into training/validation randomly.

```Resize(192)``` ensures all images are the same size before training.
