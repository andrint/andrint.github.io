## What is Deep learning?

Deep learning is a computer technique for processing and extracting information from data using neural networks. Neural networks are inspired by the human brain — they consist of multiple layers of perceptrons, which resembles the biological neurons. Each layer takes several inputs and produces outputs based on weights and thresholds.
These systems can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as:
- 🗣️ Language prosessing, example chatGPT

- 👁️ Computer vision (e.g., facial recognition)

- 🤖 Robotics

- 🧮 Planning and optimization

- 🧠 Learning from data (Machine Learning

Deep learning is used in a wide variety of applications today, including some really exciting and impactful ones such as:

- 🏥 Medical diagnosis
- 🚙 Self driving cars
- 🕵️ Fraud and anomaly detection

# A brief history

<details> <summary> 1943 – McCulloch & Pitts: The First Artificial Neuron</summary>
In 1943, Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts introduced the first mathematical model of a neuron.

</details> <details> <summary> 1986 – Rumelhart & McClelland: Parallel Distributed Processing</summary>
In 1986, Rumelhart, McClelland, and the PDP Group published Parallel Distributed Processing, emphasizing how the brain's structure could inspire smarter computation.
They introduced the concept of distributed representations and multi-layer learning, key ideas for deep learning.

</details> <details> <summary> 1980s – Second Layer Networks & Practical Challenges</summary>
Throughout the 1980s, networks with a second hidden layer became more common, enabling approximation of complex functions.
However, these networks were often too large and slow to train.

</details> <details> <summary> 2010s – Deep Learning Becomes Practical</summary>
Only recently, with better hardware, more data, and smarter algorithms, could we train deep networks effectively.
Today, neural networks can finally perform tasks like image recognition and language generation at human levels.
